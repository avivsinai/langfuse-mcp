# How to build, run, test and debug Langfuse MCP project effectively

- We **ONLY** use `uv`/`uvx` in order to run, build our app, **do not use vanilla Python or scripts**
- Our server logs reside in `/tmp/langfuse_mcp.log` - read them in our for properly debugging our server
- For debugging Cursor MCP client, the logs exist in: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/logs/`
- In order to only find MCP related logs one can use `find ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/logs/ -type f -exec grep -i "mcp" {} \; `
- Since we aren't using SSE and there are many SSE implementations that are used, one can also use `find ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/logs/ -type f -exec grep -i "mcp" {} \; | grep -v "SSE error"`
